Generate landing pages in bulk based on location with randomized content. Update thousands of landing pages in seconds.


== Description ==
The SEO Landing Page Generator lets you automatically generate thousands of location specific landing pages, with the help of template pages. Just create a template page, pick which of the 50,000 US cities you need a landing pages for and the plugin creates them automatically based on the content of the template page. The template page content can be filled with location shortcodes that will be replaced with location specific information when a landing page is rendered, to make the text specific to a cities landing page.

But that's not all. You can also add content and images for each individual landing page if you like. The plugin also works with the [SEO Content Randomizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-content-randomizer/), a plugin that lets you randomize content. This way you can make sure that no two landing pages look the same. XML and HTML sitemaps are automatically created as well.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Landing Page? =

Landing pages are generated based on the cities you activated in the plugin\'s settings panel and the template pages you create. So if a template page has the name \"My Service\" and the city Troy in Michigan is activated, one landing page that will be created will be named \"My Service in Troy, Michigan\". The landing page will contain the content you entered on the template page and fill the placeholders with information specific to Troy in Michigan.

= What is a Template Page? =

As the name suggests, template pages are used as templates for landing pages and promote services you offer. You write quality content once on the template page, and use placeholders in the text that will be filled in with location specific text when a visitor opens a landing page. Updating content on the template page automatically updates all the correlating landing pages too.
